Question #1
individual 3: sampled 61 times
individual 27: sampled 5 times

#! /bin/bash
cut -f 1 $1 | grep -c -w $2
#the first half of the code cuts to the first column of the file that we are looking for.
#the second counts the occurances of the individuals. 

#! /bin/bash
individual_ids=$(tail -n +2 $1 | tr -s "\t" "," | cut -f 1 $1 | uniq)
for ID in $individual_ids 
 do
	echo "Individual $ID was sampled this many times: "
	tail -n +2 $1 | tr -s "\t" "," | grep -c $ID $1
 done	
#In order to do this, we need to idenitfy what we are looking for which is individual_ids
#we need to feed that file and the specific row of that file into the for loop
#the for loop will read every file and spit out the count for each individual
#this loop will count every time each individual was sampled

#! /bin/bash
echo "Name of File: $1"
rows=$(tail -n +1 $1 | wc -l)
echo "Number of Rows: $rows"
columns=$(head -n +1 $1 | tr " " "\n" | wc -w)
echo "Number of Columns: $columns"
#this will count the rows and columns without the white space
